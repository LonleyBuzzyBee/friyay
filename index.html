<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>So a little bit about me, I really love dancing, music, traveling, art, games, and outdoors activities. I'd consider myself a jack of all trades because I like to dabble in a little bit of everything when it it comes to my hobbies. I enjoy all forms of dancing, and consider it and music an important part of my life. I appreciate all forms of dancing from swing to salsa and look forward to learning more dance styles this year. When the weather permits, I love hiking, camping, dogwalking and picnics. When it's a bit nasty I love going to shows/ live performances(saw my first ballet, looking forward to the next one!), bar hoping, and going dancing. Sunday swing at norse hall is always fun.</p>

<h3>A little background info</h3>
<p>Im 21 years old and I'm currently enrolled at Epicodus. I would consider myself a hardworker, and it's one thing I'm very proud of. I never have less than two jobs, from working at a deli, being a hostess to my last job medical billing; I always make sure to put in my 100%. One thing I accomplished at my previous job that brings me joy, is that I was able to get a promotion within one year of employment with that company. I started out as a receptionist, and was promoted to as position in their patient relations/ medical billing department. Although my coworkers in that department all had associates in insurance coding, I was hired in based off experience, my work ethic and my ability to operate in our EMR system. I have done some collage classes, but I currently do not have a degree. I grew an intrest in the coding industry through conversations from people in that field, and personal research. When I went through Epicodus' website, i felt like i could really benefit from the curriculum and learn a lot of valuable life skills. So, now i'm here!   </p>
