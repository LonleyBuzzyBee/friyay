      <h2><strong>About Me</strong></h2>
      <p class="lead">I'm 21 years old, I'm currently a student at Epicodus, and I work part time on the weekends. I really love dancing, music, traveling, art, games, and outdoors activities. I'd consider myself a <em>Jack of all trades</em> because I like to dabble in a little bit of everything when it it comes to my hobbies, interests, and work experience.</p>

      <h2><strong>A little background info</strong></h2>
      <p>I would consider myself a hardworker, and it's one thing I'm <em>very</em> proud of! I never have less than two jobs, from working at a deli, being a hostess to my last job medical billing; I always make sure to put in my 100%. One thing I accomplished at my previous job that brings me joy, is that <mark>I was promoted within one year of employment with that company.</mark> I started out as a receptionist, and was promoted to a position in their patient relations/ medical billing department. Although my coworkers in that department all had associates in insurance coding, I was promoted based off experience, my work ethic and my ability to operate in our EMR system. I have done some collage classes, but I currently do not have a degree. I grew an interest in the coding industry through conversations from people in that field, and personal research. When I went through Epicodus' website, I felt like i could really benefit from the curriculum and learn a lot of valuable life skills. So, now i'm here!</p>
